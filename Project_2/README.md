# Assigned Project 2

## Final Policy Evaluation
### ECR
`python3 MDP_policy.py Training_data.csv` will run the MDP program and get the best ECR value along with its policy. 
### IS
`python3 MDP_policy.py Training_data_is.csv` will run the MDP program and get the best IS value along with its policy. 

## Feature Discretization

## Feature Selection 
### Genetic Algorithm
`python3 repeat.py` will call `genetic.py` to run some iterations of genetic algorithm for searching for some features. The log is saved in `bin_NUM_history` folder where NUM is the number of bins.
